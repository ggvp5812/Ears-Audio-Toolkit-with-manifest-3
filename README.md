# Ears-Audio-Toolkit-with-manifest-3
Unofficial port of "Ears Audio Toolkit" to Manifest V3. Fixes tab capture using Offscreen API for modern browsers. This port was made with the help of AI (LLMs) to bridge the gap between Manifest V2 and V3.


This is an unofficial port of the popular "Ears" extension, updated to work with Manifest V3.

## Why?
I was honestly tired of manually re-enabling Manifest V2 support in Chrome flags and registries just to keep my EQ working. Chrome is killing MV2, and toggling that "Allow deprecated extensions" thing is a pain in the neck.
So, I decided to fix it once and for all. I spent some time vibecoding with AI to port the original logic into this Manifest V3 version. Now it just works without any extra hacks or warnings.
